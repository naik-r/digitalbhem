## Digitalbhem Internship : Hotel Booking Registration Form

## Introduction

During my internship at Digitalbhem, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project that involved creating a Hotel Booking Registration Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This experience not only allowed me to apply my coding skills but also provided valuable insights into web development and user interface design.

## Project Overview

The Hotel Booking Registration Form project aimed to design and implement a user-friendly web form that allows users to book hotel rooms seamlessly. The form was developed using a combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. The project's main goal was to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience while collecting essential information for hotel room reservations.

## Technologies Used

1. **HTML**: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was used to create the basic structure of the registration form. It provided the foundation for defining the various form elements such as input fields, buttons, and labels.

2. **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were employed to style the form and make it visually appealing. I utilized CSS properties to customize the form's layout, fonts, colors, and overall aesthetics.

3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript played a crucial role in enhancing the form's interactivity. I implemented client-side validation to ensure that users entered valid and complete information. This involved checking for empty fields, verifying email formats, and validating phone numbers.

## Conclusion

My internship experience at Digitalbhem allowed me to work on a practical project that combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a Hotel Booking Registration Form. Through this project, I honed my coding skills, learned about web development best practices, and gained insights into user interface design. This experience was instrumental in enhancing my abilities as a developer and deepening my passion for front-end web development.
